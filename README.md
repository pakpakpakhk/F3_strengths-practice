# F3 Strengths Practice (Methodist College)

Interactive, client-side activity for Form 3 students to practise identifying **overuse/misuse** vs **underuse** of VIA character strengths, then write reflections and export a **summary PNG** (for submission via LoiLoNote / Classroom).

**Live site:** https://pakpakpakhk.github.io/F3_strengths-practice/

## How it works
- Choose a strength → system shows a random scenario (overuse **or** underuse)
- Student selects their judgement → instant ✅/❌ feedback
- Student answers 4 prompts (reason, impact, adjust-to-“just right”, 7-day action)
- Click **完成本回合並產生摘要** → a screenshot-ready summary card appears
- Click **下載摘要 PNG** or take a device screenshot to submit
